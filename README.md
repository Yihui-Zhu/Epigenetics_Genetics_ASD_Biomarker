## Epigenetics Genetics ASD Biomarker

•	Identified epigenetics (WGBS) targeted regions associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as biomarker for early detection and optimized detection and calling algorithm with validation.  

•	Utilized WGS to uncover genetics profiles and identified structural variations on targeted regions. 

•	Examined the top targeted novel transcripts function using RNA-seq.
